# Building Android GPU Inspector

AGI uses the [Bazel build system](https://bazel.build/). The recommended version of Bazel is **4.2.0**.

Bazel is able to fetch most of the dependencies required to build AGI, but currently the Android SDK and NDK both need to be downloaded and installed by hand.

Please see the following OS specific guides for setting up the build environment.

After setting up the build environment, AGI can be built in a terminal with:

```
cd <path-to-agi-source>
bazel build pkg
```

> :warning: We currently use NDK r21d to have access to the unified Khronos
> validation layer. Bazel 2.0.0 has no official support for r21d, so **the
> following build warning is expected and can be ignored:**
>
> ```
> WARNING: The major revision of the Android NDK referenced by
> android_ndk_repository rule 'androidndk' is 21. The major
> revisions supported by Bazel are [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
> 17, 18, 19, 20]. Bazel will attempt to treat the NDK as if it
> was r20. This may cause compilation and linkage problems.
> Please download a supported NDK version.
> ```
>
> This issue is tracked by https://github.com/google/agi/issues/305

The build output will be at `<path-to-agi-source>/bazel-bin/pkg`.

## Windows

### Install Chocolatey

[Follow these instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install Chocolatey.

### Install Bazel

Start a console, with administrator privilege, and type:

`choco install bazel --version 2.0.0`

In the same console, install Python and MSYS2 as well:

`choco install python`
`choco install msys2`

### Install additional tools

From the Start Menu select the `MSYS2 64bit / MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit` shell:
1. Update MSYS2 with: `pacman -Syu`.
2. If the update ends with “close the window and run it again”, close and reopen the window and repeat 1.
3. Fetch required tools with: `pacman -S curl git zip unzip patch`
4. Download gcc with: `curl -O http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-10.2.0-10-any.pkg.tar.zst`
5. Download gcc-libs with: `curl -O http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libs-10.2.0-10-any.pkg.tar.zst`
6. Install the downloaded packages with: `pacman -U mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc*-10.2.0-10-any.pkg.tar.zst`
7. Close the MSYS2 terminal

### Install Java Development Kit 1.8

A JDK is required to run a custom build of AGI. If you do not already have a suitable JDK installed,
you can [download the OpenJDK](http://jdk-mirror.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) we use on our
build bots.

Make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the JDK.

### Install Android SDK and NDK

If you have Android Studio installed, use it to install:
* SDK Platform: `Android 8.0 (Oreo) - API Level 26`
* SDK Tools: `NDK (Side by side) - 21.3.6528147`

Otherwise you can use the basic Android command line tools:
1. Create a directory for the Android SDK, for example `C:\Android\sdk\`.
1. Create the subdirectories `<sdk-path>\cmdline-tools\latest\`. This exact name allows the tools to determine the SDK directory.
1. Download the tools from [Android Studio downloads](https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads).
1. Extract the tools somewhere and move the contents of `cmdline-tools\` to the created `<sdk-path>\cmdline-tools\latest\`.
1. Use a console to fetch the required packages:

    ```
    cd <sdk-path>
    cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat "platforms;android-26"
    cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat "build-tools;30.0.3"
    cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat "ndk;21.3.6528147"
    ```

1. If you do not have adb installed you can do so with:
    ```
    cd <sdk-path>
    cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat platform-tools
    ```

### Configure the environment

Either do this globally or in your shell every time.

Make sure the environment is setup before you run bazel (`bazel shutdown` will shut it down).

1. Add MSYS2 binary directories to the PATH:
   `set PATH=C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin;C:\tools\msys64\mingw64\bin;%PATH%`
   Running `where gcc` should now find mingw’s gcc.

1. Set TMP to something very short. `C:\tmp` is known to work. For faster builds, add this folder to the excemptions of the Windows Defender anti-malware scanner.

The following environment variables will need to be set prior to building:

| Variable            | Target                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANDROID_HOME`      | Path to Android SDK, e.g. `C:\Android\sdk`                  |
| `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`  | Path to Android NDK, e.g. `%ANDROID_HOME%\ndk\21.3.6528147` |
| `BAZEL_SH`          | `C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe`                          |
| `TMP`               | `C:\tmp`                                                    |

## MacOS

### Install Bazel

Follow the [MacOS Bazel Install](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-os-x.html) directions to install bazel.

### Install Java Development Kit 1.8

A JDK is required to run a custom build of AGI. If you do not already have a suitable JDK installed,
you can [download the OpenJDK](http://jdk-mirror.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) we use on our
build bots.

Make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the JDK.

> :warning: If you find the application menu bar non-responsive when launching your build of AGI,
> the following command should fix it:
> `sudo mkdir $JAVA_HOME/bin/Contents`

### Install Android SDK and NDK

Unzip the [Android SDK](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-darwin-3859397.zip) to a directory of your choosing.

To fetch the required packages, using a console type:

```
cd <sdk-path>
tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-26" "build-tools;30.0.3"
```

If you do not have adb installed you can do so with:
```
cd <sdk-path>
tools/bin/sdkmanager platform-tools
```

Install
[Android NDK **r21d**](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r21d-darwin-x86_64.dmg) (installing the App Bundle is needed in order to keep the notarization)
into the /Applications/ folder, and set the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment pointing to NDK subdirectory:

```
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/Applications/AndroidNDK6528147.app/Contents/NDK
```

### Install the XCode command line tools

After installing, ensure the XCode license is signed with:

```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

### Increase the maximum number of OS file handles

Bazel can concurrently use more file handles than the OS supports by default. This can be easily fixed by typing:

```
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=122880
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=102400
echo ulimit -S -n 102400 >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Configure the environment

Either do this globally or in your shell every time.

Make sure the environment is setup before you run bazel (`bazel shutdown` will shut it down).

The following environment variables will need to be set prior to building:

| Variable            | Target               |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `ANDROID_HOME`      | Path to Android SDK  |
| `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`  | Path to Android NDK  |
