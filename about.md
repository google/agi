Our vision is to help you profile and debug graphics on Android, regardless of device. AGI is an [open source]({{site.project-url}}) GPU profiler and debugger for Android applications that use Vulkan or OpenGL ES. <br>

This project is currently in open beta and under active development. It has some [known issues]({{site.project-url}}/issues). Your feedback is appreciated!
