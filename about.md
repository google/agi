Android GPU Inspector is an [open source]({{site.project-url}}) GPU profiler and debugger for Android applications. <br>
Currently, only Vulkan applications are supported. Our vision is to help you profile and debug graphics on Android, regardless of device.

This project is under active development and has some [known issues]({{site.project-url}}/issues). Your feedback is appreciated!
