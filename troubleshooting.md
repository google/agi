Please ensure that your setup meets all of the [requirements](../requirements).

## Profiling on Android does not work

-   Stop any program that may interact with the device over ADB, such as Android
    Studio.

-   Enable the **Stay awake** option (under **Developer options** on Android) to
    prevent issues that arise when the device screen turns off due to sleep
    mode.

-   The target application must _not_ report any warning or error when run with
    [Vulkan validation layers](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/validation-layer)
    enabled.

## Android Vulkan layers issues

If a Vulkan capture on Android does not terminate properly, Android
GPU Inspector may leave some Android settings related to Vulkan layers
in a state that may pertubate subsequent runs of the app. These
settings are:

-   `enable_gpu_debug_layers`

-   `gpu_debug_app`

-   `gpu_debug_layers`

-   `gpu_debug_layer_app`

If your app has some Vulkan layer issues after you used Android GPU
Inspector, you may try and clear these settings with the following
`adb` commands:

```sh
adb shell settings delete global enable_gpu_debug_layers
adb shell settings delete global gpu_debug_app
adb shell settings delete global gpu_debug_layers
adb shell settings delete global gpu_debug_layer_app
```

See also the [Android documentation on how to use settings to enable Vulkan layers](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/validation-layer?release=r21#enable-layers-outside-app).
